Happy Ocean Project

I'm Alex Ogden and this is my capstone project for MCAD's MA in Graphic and Web Design program.

Happy Ocean Project Brief:

"A happy ocean is a clean ocean!"

KEYWORDS: 
environmentalism, ocean cleanup, plastic pollution, interactive story, animation, edutainment, optimistic, whimsical, fun 

SUMMARY:
Happy Ocean is conceived as a website that addresses the urgent issue of ocean pollution—specifically how plastic pollution affects marine animals—through an interactive, animated story. Additionally, the site aims to provide resources pertaining to ocean cleanup and conservation initiatives. This project is meant to confront and discuss the seriousness of plastic in our ocean and the threat it poses to marine animals in an engaging, approachable, and optimistic way. The site and story are intended for all ages. 

The Happy Ocean website has three main components: first, the animated story that users will unravel and discover as they interact with the site; second, information and network sections that will detail how visitors can help preserve the ocean and connect with other ocean cleanup initiatives; third, an online shop featuring Happy Ocean merchandise such as tote bags, t-shirts, books, artwork, Happy Ocean mascot toys, and enamel pins. A portion of profits will be donated to organizations that help clean up the ocean and preserve marine animals.
